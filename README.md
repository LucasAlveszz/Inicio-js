# First JavaScript Project

Simple project using:
- variables
- if / else
- console.log

My first contact with JavaScript logic.


# JavaScript Type and Parity Checker

## Description
This project is a simple JavaScript program created to practice basic programming concepts such as:
- data types
- strict comparison
- conditional statements
- parity checking

The program analyzes a value, checks its type, verifies if it is possible to calculate parity, and compares two values using strict equality.

## Features
- Identifies the type of a value
- Checks if a number is even or odd
- Prevents invalid operations on non-number types
- Compares two values using strict equality (`===`)
- Displays clear messages in the console

## Technologies
- JavaScript (ES6)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project folder
3. Run the file using Node.js:
   ```bash
